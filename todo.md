# TODO: Blood Pressure Log Simulator Implementation

## Overview
Create a mobile-first web application that generates realistic, random blood pressure readings with a simple tap interface and localStorage-based data management.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Data Engine (Priority: High)
```
[Data Generation] -> [Validation] -> [Constraints Check]
```
- [ ] Create `lib/bloodPressureGenerator.ts` with realistic BP generation algorithm
- [ ] Implement systolic range: 90-140 mmHg with proper randomization
- [ ] Implement diastolic range: 60-90 mmHg with proper randomization  
- [ ] Ensure realistic pulse pressure (20-60 mmHg difference between systolic/diastolic)
- [ ] Add validation functions for physiological constraints
- [ ] Create utility functions for range checking and boundary enforcement

### Phase 2: Storage Management (Priority: High)
```
[App Start] -> [Check State] -> [Generate/Restore] -> [Persist Index] -> [Continue Session]
```
- [ ] Create `lib/storageManager.ts` for localStorage operations
- [ ] Implement startup logic to detect first-time vs returning user
- [ ] Generate complete dataset of all 1,581 possible BP combinations (51×31) on first launch
- [ ] Implement Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm for randomization
- [ ] Store shuffled complete dataset in localStorage (~32KB)
- [ ] Implement persistent index tracking that survives app restarts
- [ ] Add state restoration logic to continue from previous session
- [ ] Create data integrity validation on app startup
- [ ] Implement re-shuffle when all readings used (after 1,581 taps) with index reset
- [ ] Handle corrupted state recovery and fallback to fresh generation
- [ ] Handle edge cases (localStorage full, disabled, corrupted data)
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for storage failures

### Phase 3: UI Foundation (Priority: Medium)
```
[Layout] -> [Components] -> [Mobile Responsive] -> [Styling]
```
- [ ] Create main blood pressure display component
- [ ] Design mobile-first responsive layout using TailwindCSS
- [ ] Implement tap interaction handler with proper touch events
- [ ] Style with professional/discreet appearance (clean, medical-like)
- [ ] Add proper typography and spacing for readability
- [ ] Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG guidelines)

### Phase 4: Integration & User Experience (Priority: Medium)
```
[Connect Data] -> [Add Interactions] -> [Polish UX] -> [Error Handling]
```
- [ ] Connect blood pressure generator to UI components
- [ ] Integrate localStorage management with UI state
- [ ] Add smooth transitions between readings
- [ ] Implement loading states and feedback
- [ ] Add error handling for storage and generation failures
- [ ] Optimize for touch interactions and mobile gestures

### Phase 5: Testing & Polish (Priority: Low)
```
[Unit Tests] -> [Integration Tests] -> [Device Testing] -> [Optimization]
```
- [ ] Write unit tests for blood pressure generation logic
- [ ] Create integration tests for storage management
- [ ] Test on various mobile devices and screen sizes
- [ ] Performance optimization and bundle size analysis
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- [ ] Final polish and user experience refinements

## Dependencies
- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 3 (UI needs data)
- Phase 2 can run parallel to Phase 1
- Phase 4 requires completion of Phases 1-3
- Phase 5 requires all previous phases

## Key Files to Create
- `lib/bloodPressureGenerator.ts` - Core generation logic
- `lib/storageManager.ts` - localStorage operations with state persistence
- `lib/types.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for app state and storage
- `app/components/BloodPressureDisplay.tsx` - Main UI component
- `app/page.tsx` - Updated main page integration

## Technical Considerations
- Use existing Next.js 15 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS stack
- Leverage React hooks for state management
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow mobile-first design principles
- Maintain clean, professional appearance

## Progress Tracking
- [ ] Phase 1 Complete
- [ ] Phase 2 Complete
- [ ] Phase 3 Complete
- [ ] Phase 4 Complete
- [ ] Phase 5 Complete

## Notes
Based on PRD requirements for blood pressure log simulator with:
- Realistic BP generation (Systolic: 90-140, Diastolic: 60-90)
- Simple tap interface
- Complete dataset approach (1,581 unique combinations)
- Mobile-first design
- Professional, discreet appearance

## Storage Strategy Benefits
- **No duplicates possible** until all 1,581 combinations used
- **Supports heavy usage**: 400 readings/month uses only 25% of dataset
- **Session continuity**: App remembers exact position across restarts
- **Data integrity**: Validation ensures corrupted data is handled gracefully
- **Predictable storage**: Fixed ~32KB localStorage requirement
- **True randomization**: Fisher-Yates shuffle ensures even distribution

## State Persistence Details
- **Storage Keys**: 
- `bp-dataset`: Complete shuffled array of 1,581 readings
- `bp-index`: Current position (0-1580)
- `bp-timestamp`: Last generation time for validation
- **App Flow**: Check existing → Validate → Restore/Generate → Continue
- **Error Recovery**: Corrupted data triggers fresh generation with user notification
